# ConversationLearner-UI Test Automation

This is a Cypress.io based test automation project

# General Assumptions

1. Test cases are broken into small discrete pieces at logical stopping points.
2. The model generated by a successful test case is manually exported into a file.
3. Subsequent test cases will import models generated by other successful test cases and carry on with more advanced testing.

The benefits of this approach are:
1. Each test case is small in size and easier to understand and maintain.
2. Execution time is shortened.
3. A failing test, which is just a portion of a larger scenario, does not prevent another test, which is a continuation of the scenario, from passing.
4. Reproducing a bug is easier since you can import a model just prior to the point of failure and then manually carry on from that point, which should be just a few steps away from the failure.
